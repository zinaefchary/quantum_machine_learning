# Quantum Machine Learning

Quantum phenomena such as entanglement, tunnelling or superposition are
increasingly used in quantum information to perform computation. Moreover,
machine learning methods are driving a paradigm shift in the field of artificial
intelligence. This project aims to explore the possibility of implementing quantum
phenomena into machine learning algorithms. A theoretical approach to achieve
this is proposed by modifying the architecture of a classical image recognition
neural network such that it imitates the behaviour of a single Q-bit in a magnetic
field. The resulting quantum-inspired neural network reaches an average accuracy
of 70.2% in classifying handwritten digits of 0 and 1.
